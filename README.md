2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are larger and darker in color.

   * Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * legend provide context for map data.
